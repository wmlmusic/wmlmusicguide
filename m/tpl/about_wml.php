Following years of behind the scenes networking relationships gradually built with various individuals throughout the world within music and entertainment. What started out as a travel to the West Indies on a visit to spend time with family eventually turned into creating a genuine and authentic secure platform for the people allowing a direct hands-on approach to dealing with their business ventures. A growing interest of talents inquiring on branching out and gaining legitimate work outside of their local scene within their respective fields across a broader spectrum gave life to what would later become World Music Listing.
